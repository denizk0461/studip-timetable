## WeserPlaner â€“ University of Bremen Companion App
WeserPlaner is a work-in-progress Android app for students at the University of Bremen that allows the user to download their schedule from their Stud.IP account, as well as viewing the offers available in all of the canteens operated by the Studierendenwerk Bremen. Handy features are available, such as adding new events and editing existing events, filtering canteen offers only for such that conform to the user's dietary and ethical preferences (e.g. only displaying vegetarian foods), and filtering out any offers including substances the user is allergic against.

## Progress
- Downloading and creating events, as well as displaying them is fully functional.
- Downloading canteen offers, filtering them, and viewing details is fully functional.
- Viewing additional information on the canteen (opening hours, news) works.

## What's broken
Currently, nothing is outright broken, but a few things may be bodged together.

## TODO
- Adding exams, homework, etc.: users will be able to add any tasks they need to do as reminders. Those can be associated with events that either have been downloaded from the user's Stud.IP schedule, or ones the user has created manually. An overview will be provided that allows the user to have, well, an overview of everything they need to do.
- Optimisations to data handling will be made. The app currently only supports storing a single timetable, which will be changed in future releases. A planned implementation will see the user being able to download schedules as well as create ones from scratch, with the schedules able to be selected via a dropdown menu. 
- Some UI restructuring to declutter certain screens and improve the UX.

## Why Android-only?
Because:
- I know Android development and it's a lot easier for me to work on an app using a framework I already know than to learn a new one while still trying to keep up with my responsibilities at university, and
- because Apple is a greedy company that charges thousands for laptops, phones, as well as $99 a year for a developer account, which are all requirements (sans the phone, if I was to use their simulator, which isn't ideal) and I, as a student, simply do not have the money for that.

I may reconsider once Apple finally opens up iOS for third-party apps.

## Why this logo? Why this evil red colour scheme?

The colour scheme is inspired by the University of Bremen's colour scheme, as well as the city of Bremen's colour scheme. The logo represents both the University of Bremen as well as (kind of) the Weserstadion, our local sports stadium.

I admit the Weserstadion idea came to me after I had created the logo.
